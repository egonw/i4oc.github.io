# Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC) website material

This GitHub repository contains all the material used for the website of the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC) available at https://i4oc.org.

## How to be involved

A publisher, that is a participant in the Crossref Cited-by service, will be listed in those participating to I4OC if it is compliant with all the following points:

1. Be listed at https://www.crossref.org/reports/members-with-open-references/, which means the publisher is releasing all or part of its citations as open material via Crossref;
2. The percentage of articles with references deposited in Crossref included in the limited and closed datasets must be lesser than the 20% of the total amount of articles with references deposited;
3. It is depositing 'current references' (see the table at point 1, column 5 greater than 0 and column 7 set to "true") or it is willing to deposite 'current references' (column 7 set to "true") and it is depositing 'backfile references' (column 4 greater than 0 and column 6 set to "true").
